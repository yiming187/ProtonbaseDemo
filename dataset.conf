# ProtonBase Dataset Configuration
# This file controls the size of generated test datasets
# Modify the values below to suit your testing needs

# Dataset size options:
# - 1000: Quick test (< 1 minute, good for development)
# - 10000: Medium test (1-2 minutes, good for feature testing)  
# - 100000: Large test (5-10 minutes, good for performance testing)
# - 1000000: Full scale (15-30 minutes, enterprise-level testing)

# Current setting: Medium test dataset
DATASET_SIZE=10000

# Performance test settings
# Set to true to run performance tests after data generation
RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=true

# Memory optimization settings
# Batch size for large datasets (adjust based on available memory)
BATCH_SIZE=5000

# Notes:
# - Larger datasets provide more realistic performance testing
# - Consider your database server capacity when choosing size
# - Full scale (1M records) requires significant storage space (~500MB-1GB)
# - Performance may vary based on hardware and network latency
